# Node/Express/EJS/Mongoose site with related collection schemas 

This site shows a book store that displays books, the information of which comes from two collections in the MongoDB database. The Mongoose ODM (Object Document Mapper) is used to connect (with `ref` and `populate()`) the two schemas for the collections **Books** and **Persons** much as `JOIN` does in an SQL database between tables.
